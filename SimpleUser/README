TODO: Clean this whole thing up to maven.  Converge webapp and rest controllers and UI, fix/eliminate ant build.


SimpleApp is a simple application to show various conventions for using JEE technologies and patterns.

TODO: NEED TO REWRITE THIS WHOLE THING SINCE MAVEN CONVERSION.  EITHER ELIMINATE OR FIX ANT BUILD.

CONFIGURATION:  The application has been tested and run on Tomcat 7.  So you'll need that or something similar.  The database
is setup as a MySQL database using InnoDB:
  - You'll need a schema called "simpleapp" 
  - A user called "simpleapp", password: "simple314"
  - You'll need to run the database DDL script using the file "WebContent/database/createstuff.sql"
  - JDBC Connections are assumed to use "localhost:3306" for mysql database.  If you want something else, you'll need to change,
  	"META-INF/context.xml." Everything in Spring, JDBC, and Hibernate uses the JNDI datasource from context.xml  

Building:
	- Download the project using git clone. <Address>
	- You'll need to run Maven to get the required dependencies.  Assuming some unix like environment, go to the 
  	"SimpleUser" directory and run "mvn dependency:copy-dependencies" which will download the necessary JAR files for
  	the application.  I'm using Maven for repository and dependency management only, not for build function.   
	- In the same directory, run "ant createdb".  Assuming you're MySQL is localhost, it'll create the required database artifacts and insert some records. 
	- Use ant to build to build the project <command and dir>
	- Drop into your tomcate webapps
  - Go to:

1) Simple JDBC
First example is a simple JDBC application that stores, changes, retrieves data in a single table SIMPLEAPP.USER.
All actions are based on the base objects in the "classes/object" package.  There are two primary classes, 
User and Role following conventional Javabean standards with the addition of an constructors added simply 
for me to mess around.
	- I use simple DAO pattern for this found in classes/DAO.simpleDAO: "UserDAO"(interface) and "UserDAOImplSimple"
		(implementation).  
	- There's also a simple Factory pattern show in "classes/commonDAO"
	- Connections to the database are managed through the "DBConnection" class in the "simpleJDBC" package.
	- Once you've set everything up and are ready to run it, go to <yourhost:port>/SimpleApp
	- There are a set of links to the sample apps, which run a set of cactus servlet tests to make sure it all works
	  and displays the status.  You can see the test implementations (which shows use of various patterns and
	  implementation) in "classes/test/<classes>".  For example they'll show calls to the factory and creation
	  of DAO objects.  For this one, click the "Go to the Simple JDBC Tests" link.
	- The test servlet is test.SimpleDAOTestServlet
	  
2) Put on the fancy shoes: Hibernate, DAO, Generics 
The second example is sort of two examples combined into one.  The fist one is standard Hibernate using the
standard hibernate.cfg.xml style of development with mappings included in the related files.  To use the example, 
you need to edit the WEB-INF/web.xml file and remove the VALUE of the HibernateConfigFile param.  So you'd have
the param set and the value should be blank: "<param-value></param-value>".  Then run it and click the 
"Go to the DAO Hibernate Tests."  This tests all of the primary methods in DAO.hibernateDAO.UserDAOImpl with the
following method signatures:
- public void saveUser(User user) {...}
- public void updateUser(User user) {...}
- public User findUserByUsername(String username) {...}
- public void deleteUser(User user) {...}
- public List<User> listUsers() {...}
- public List<User> listUsersByRoles(String role) {...} (This one is to show successful implementation of the 
Many-to-Many relationship and the use of HQL and the HQL Entity facility and adding functionality subclasses).

You can understand the database structure by looking at the createstuff.sql file, the hibernate config files, or the 
object.User and object.Role files by looking at the JPA annotations.

This sample also shows a much more advanced DAO strategy than that of the SimpleJDBC stuff using a stronger 
inheritance and calling model including generic type persistence objects which can be seen in 
DAO.hibernateDAO.CommonDAO and DAO.hibernateDAO.CommonDAOImpl.  The DAO.hibernateDAO.UserDAOImpl shows the 
actual implementation, the transactions, and the HQL if any.  Finally a UserDAOHibOnlyImpl for instantiation pattern for
this example.

I'm also using DAO.hibernateDAO.HibUtil to manage sessions, transactions, that sort of thing.

I know some people like to use a "Manager" style DAO as another level of indirection, but I figured I'd gone far 
enough for my purposes.

The test servlet is test.HibernateDAOTestServlet.

3) Fancy shoes with @ signs.  JPA/Annotations
The third example show's use of JPA annotations for the implementation, but in all other ways is exactly the same
as the one above.  If you changed it, you need to change the web.xml file back to it's original state using the
<param-value>hibernateAnnotations.cfg.xml</param-value>.  Then a different hibernate config file will be loaded at
runtime which tells the system to use annotations instead of standard hibernate config.  I know it's not a true
JPA application since I'm using Hibernate's session stuff rather than EntityManager convention.  So it's not a 
truly portable JPA application. 

Run the same test servlet as in example 2.  Fun. 

4) Shoes with a Spring in your step.  
The Spring sample is built using the sample DAO structure and inheritance structure as the Hibernate ones.  It's just using Spring
injection to manage the session, transactions, all that sort of thing.  You can see the samples in CommonDAOSpringImpl, UserDAOHibSpringImpl which
use the CommonDAO and UserDAO just as the last two examples did.

This example also uses Entity Manager for true javax.persistence rather than hibernate's SessionFactory.

The link to run the cactus tests for this is on the index page and the Servlet is test.HibernateSpringDAOTestServlet.

I also wrote a simple servlet using Spring MVC to show a sample of that as well both running and using annotation.  That's the
"Add a Person..." link on the index page.
	  
OTHER
  - I use Logback for logging.  right now it's a very simple setup to send everything to the console.
    It's also set at debug.  You can change the log level if you want.
  - I know my tests aren't traditional setup/teardown style.  They're really just servlets using Cactus/JUnit
  	to make sure stuff works and show the concepts of DAO, Factory, Hibernate, stuff like that.
  	
 HUGE TODO's
 - Move everything to a standard JEE directory structure for Maven
 - Tests for Spring stuff servlet stuff.
